            <h2 style="padding-left:50px;">About Hetton Ice Tea</h2>
            <p id="mainText">
            Brewed by a collection of England born gentleman in Hetton, this drink (created by accident) has risen to be
            the most poplar option for respectable men to drink. Paired with a Cuban cigar or just on its own 
            the Hetton Ice Tea's continental flavours can be enjoyed by people from all walks of life, due to 
            variety given and presentation of this body warming cocktail. The brewers may have initialy had the concept
            in order to drug and fuck up members of their league, yet it has been refined and perfected over the many
            year and has now become a staple of British alcoholism and cocktail mixing. Little can be remembered
            from the night of the very first creation as it is said to have taken place over months ago. The gentlemen
            were also severely intoxicated from tasting and enjoying the drink themselves, similar to when
            the great late Albert Hofmann synthesised LSD and accidently had the first acid experience. The truth
            is that your very first Hetton Ice Tea is greater than your first LSD trip so purchase a crate now to experience
            what it is like to break through to the other side of alcoholism.</p>

                Hetton is a small Dales village in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England, situated 5.75 miles north of Skipton by the B6265 road. It is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Hetton-cum-Bordley. The population of the former civil parish of Hetton taken at the 2011 Census was 155.
                Nearby places include Rylstone, Cracoe, Flasby, Threapland and Winterburn. 
                Hetton was historically part of the township of Hetton with Bordley in the ancient parish of Burnsall in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In the late 19th century it became a separate township, and it became a separate civil parish in 1866. It was transferred to the new county of North Yorkshire in 1974.
