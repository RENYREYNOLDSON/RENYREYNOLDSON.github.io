    <h2 id="mainText">About Always Sunny In Philadelphia</h2>
    <p id="mainText">The series follows "The Gang", a group of five misfit friends: twins Dennis (Glenn Howerton) and Deandra "(Sweet) Dee" Reynolds (Kaitlin Olson), their friends Charlie Kelly (Charlie Day) and Ronald "Mac" McDonald (Rob McElhenney), and (from season 2 onward) Frank Reynolds (Danny DeVito), Dennis' and Dee's legal father. The Gang runs the fictional Paddy's Pub, an unsuccessful Irish bar in South Philadelphia.

        Each member of "The Gang" displays unethical behavior and traits such as excessive drinking and drug abuse, dishonesty, cruelty, selfishness, and egotism. Episodes usually find them hatching elaborate schemes and often conspiring against one another and others for personal gain, vengeance, or simply the entertainment of watching another's downfall. They habitually inflict mental, emotional, and physical pain on each other and anyone who crosses their path. They also regularly use blackmail to manipulate one another and others outside of the group.
        
        The Gang's unity is never solid, and any of them will quickly dump any of the others for quick profit or personal gain regardless of the consequences. Despite this, they ultimately return to their usual group dynamic due to their toxic codependency. Everything they do results in contention among themselves, and much of the show's dialogue involves the characters arguing or yelling at one another. Despite their lack of success or achievements, they maintain high opinions of themselves and display an obsessive interest in their reputations and public images.
        
        The Gang has no sense of shame when attempting to get what they want and often engage in activities that others would find humiliating, disgusting, or shocking. Some of these situations include: <b>becoming addicted to crack cocaine and pretending to be mentally challenged in order to qualify for welfare; attempted cannibalism; kidnapping; blackface; hiding naked inside a couch in order to eavesdrop on people; tricking a man into giving his daughter a lap dance; forcing each other to eat inedible items; huffing paint; foraging naked in the sewers for rings and coins; sleeping with each other's romantic interests; seducing a priest; secretly feeding someone their dead pet; plugging their open wounds with trash; grave robbing; setting a room full of people on fire and locking the door to avoid an uncomfortable Thanksgiving meal; stalking their crushes; fantasizing about killing each other; taking out life insurance on a suicidal person; orally siphoning gasoline; and pretending to have AIDS in order to get priority access to water park rides</b>—among many other scenarios.
        
        During the Season 7 episode "The Gang Gets Trapped," in which The Gang breaks into a family's home and has to hide from them when they return, an angry monologue by Dennis captures the essence of The Gang's modus operandi:
        
        We immediately escalate everything to a ten... somebody comes in with some preposterous plan or idea, then all of a sudden everyone's on the gas, nobody's on the brakes, nobody's thinking, everyone's just talking over each other with one idiotic idea after another! Until, finally, we find ourselves in a situation where we've broken into somebody's house – and the homeowner is home!
        
        Except for certain rare occasions, Paddy's Pub does not do well financially. </p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<p>Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, and Rob McElhenney met each other while struggling to find acting gigs in Los Angeles. The show was born out of a short film idea written by McElhenney and Howerton "where a friend came over to another friend’s house to get sugar, and the friend tells him he has cancer, and all the guy can think about is getting his sugar and getting out of there."[5] This was then developed into a pilot called It's Always Sunny on TV and was shot on a digital camcorder[6] and filmed in the actors' own apartments.[7] They expanded the central cast to four people living in Los Angeles, "a group of best friends who care so little for each other," Howerton said.[5]

    It was believed the pilot was shot with a budget of just $200, but Day would later comment, "We shot it for nothing...I don't know where this $200 came from...We were a bunch of kids with cameras running around shooting each other and [the] next thing you know, we're eleven years in and we're still doing the show."[8] This pilot was shopped by the actors around various studios, their pitch being simply showing the DVD of the pilot to executives.[6] After viewing the pilot, FX Network ordered the first season. The show was budgeted at $450,000 an episode, less than a third of a network standard, using Panasonic's DVX100 MiniDV prosumer video camera.[6] The original concept had "the gang" being out-of-work actors with the theme song being a cha-cha version of "Hooray for Hollywood,"[9] however there were too many shows at the time with a similar premise.[5] "The network came to us and said, 'We don’t want a show about actors,' and we said, 'Fine, let’s put it somewhere else,'" McElhenney explained. "I'm from Philly, let's put it in Philly, and we'll make it about a bar, because that's a job where you can have lots of free time and still have income that could explain how these people can sustain themselves."[5] Prior to Kaitlin Olson joining the show, the character Sweet Dee was originally played by Jordan Reid, who at the time was the girlfriend of McElhenney, but was recast after they broke up.[10]
    
    After the first season, FX executives were worried about the show's low ratings and demanded that changes be made to the cast.[11] "So, John Landgraf, who's the president of FX, he called me in for a meeting and was like, 'Hey, no one's watching the show, but we love it,'" McElhenney recalled. "'We wanna keep it on, but we don't have any money for marketing, and we need to add somebody with some panache that we can hopefully parlay into some public relations story, just so we can get people talking.'"[11] FX began suggesting actors such as Danny DeVito that could boost the show's profile. "It's not that we were reticent to the idea of adding Danny to the show," Howerton recalled, "It's that we were reticent to add a name to the show. You know, because we kinda liked that we were no-names and it was this weird, small thing, you know." Initially, McElhenney refused, saying "No, I just don't think we wanna do that, and they were like, 'Oh OK, well, you know...the show's over.'" Realizing they needed to change the trajectory of the show to please the network, McElhenney, Howerton, and Day became open to adding a new cast member that was familiar to the public. DeVito joined the cast in the first episode of the second season, playing the father of Dennis and Dee.[11]
    
    Many of the filming locations for the show are in Los Angeles. The exterior of Paddy's Pub is located at the Starkman Building on 544 Mateo Street in Los Angeles.
    
    On April 1, 2016, the series was renewed for a thirteenth and fourteenth season, which matched The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet with the most seasons for a live-action sitcom in American television history.[12] On April 9, 2020, McElhenney announced that writing had begun for season 15.[13]</p>

        <h2>Cast and Characters</h2>
        <p>Charlie Day as Charlie Kelly – Charlie was a co-owner of Paddy's Pub, but traded his capital investment for "goods and services," half a sandwich, and other undisclosed compensation. He is a childhood friend of Mac, and high school friend of Dennis and Dee. He is also the roommate of Frank, who may or may not be his biological father. Charlie does most of the actual work and maintenance (referred to as "Charlie Work") at the pub. He is unable to properly read or write, and is an alcoholic substance abuser often seen huffing glue or paint, as well as eating various items not meant for human consumption, such as cat food. He lives in squalor with Frank in a run-down, vermin-infested apartment and has deep-seated psychological problems. Charlie has unresolved anger issues, often screaming to get his point across. In spite of his general lack of intelligence, Charlie is a naturally gifted musician and a self-proclaimed expert in 'bird law'. He also has an unhealthy obsession with "The Waitress," a recurring character who finds Charlie repulsive and shows no interest in him until the Season 12 finale.
            Glenn Howerton as Dennis Reynolds – Dennis is a co-owner of Paddy's Pub and Dee's twin brother. Easily the most psychopathic of the five friends, Dennis is narcissistic, superficial, hypersexual, selfish, and abrasive. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a minor in psychology. His predatory nature is often depicted through numerous attempts to seduce various women; which, when successful, result in him gaslighting and emotionally abusing them in order to win over their favour before inevitably dumping them once he has had sex with them (a method which he proudly labels "The D.E.N.N.I.S. System"). It is strongly hinted at times that Dennis may be a serial killer, though this remains ambiguous.[3] In season 10, he is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, though he frequently denies this and believes himself to be completely rational, and is convinced that he is in complete control of everything and everyone around him, going as far as to label himself a ‘golden god’. In the season 12 finale, he discovers he has an infant son and moves to North Dakota to raise him.[4] He returns to Philadelphia in season 13, supposedly supporting his family from a distance.
            Rob McElhenney as Ronald "Mac" McDonald – Mac is one of the co-owners of Paddy's Pub and also acts as the bouncer. He is Charlie's childhood friend and Dennis's high school friend and later roommate. The son of a convicted felon who has been in prison for much of Mac's life, he frequently attempts to demonstrate his toughness and refers to himself as the "sheriff of Paddy's". Deeply insecure, Mac seeks the approval of those around him, especially his father, his apathetic and emotionally absent mother, and Dennis. He suffers from body dysmorphia and has been depicted at various weights throughout the course of the series: prior to the beginning of Season 7 he gained 60 pounds (27 kg) and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, and when he finally returned to a healthy weight he admitted he missed supposedly coming across as 'scary' to people. By the time Season 13 arrived, he was noticeably ripped and physically stronger. He often brags about his hand-to-hand combat skills, but typically flees from physical confrontation and is usually depicted as the most cowardly of the gang. Mac is a Roman Catholic, though he often espouses strong Christian fundamentalist opinions, despite his often amoral behavior, such as casual sex with numerous women, including Dennis's mother. Though it is frequently insinuated Mac harbors homosexual feelings, he maintained an adamant denial of any such proclivity, much to the gang's annoyance, until he comes out in season 12. It is strongly implied that Mac is in love with Dennis.
            Kaitlin Olson as Deandra "Sweet Dee" Reynolds – Dee is Dennis's twin sister and the waitress at Paddy's Pub. Though initially depicted as 'the voice of reason' within the group, over the course of the series she gradually loses any sense of moral fortitude that she once had and is frequently shown to be just as prejudiced and depraved as her male friends. Dee wore a back brace in high school, leaving her with the nickname "The Aluminum Monster," and she is constantly referred to by the gang as a bird, due to their perception of her as a giant, awkward, avian creature. She majored in psychology at the University of Pennsylvania but did not graduate. Dee lives alone in an apartment. Though often the butt of the gang's jokes (as well as the target of most of the emotional abuse within the group), she frequently involves herself in their schemes, perhaps due to her constant need for approval and attention from her peers. She does not hold any ownership stake in the bar - perhaps due to the gang's various prejudices against her, but also in part to her desire to become a professional actress/comedienne (an ambition that when she is committed to achieving, she consistently fails to achieve due to her debilitating stage fright and her general lack of any apparent talent). In multiple episodes, it is referenced that Dee set her college roommate on fire, and is often portrayed as the most physically violent of the group.
            Danny DeVito as Frank Reynolds – Frank is the legal father of Dennis and Dee, and may be the biological father of his roommate Charlie. He used to be a successful businessman with a long history of illegal operations and dealings with sordid characters, but chose to abandon that life and redeem himself after leaving his "whore wife." He has since embraced his "feral" nature and describes himself as "fringe class". Despite his substantial financial resources, he chooses to share a decrepit studio apartment with Charlie, where they live in squalor and sleep together on a pullout couch. The two have similar interests, such as playing the inexplicable game of Night Crawlers and foraging naked in sewers for valuables, though Frank is normally depicted to be both more physically and morally depraved than Charlie (since Charlie's behaviors mostly stem from peer pressure and a lack of overall intelligence). Frank is also a severe compulsive gambler, seen betting on everything from grade school basketball to Russian roulette. He styles himself a master manipulator and frequently takes the lead in the group's schemes. He always arms himself with at least one loaded handgun (and does not hesitate to brandish or even discharge one when provoked) and often snorts cocaine as part of his daily routine.</p>
